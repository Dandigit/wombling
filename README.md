# Wombling
As much as I love C++, it does admittedly have some serious shortcomings. Unfortunately, these shortcomings can be frustrating, inconvenient 
and downright senseless. Over time I've found myself developing solutions to these issues over many different projects - so I created Wombling 
to bring them all together in one place.
